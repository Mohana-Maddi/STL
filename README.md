## About This Project
This project is part of my Global Graduate Project, where I aim to explore and highlight the rich culture, history, and attractions of cities around the world. For this specific project, I focused on St. Louis, Missouri, to showcase some of the city's best free attractions and activities. Through this project, I hope to inspire others to explore St. Louis and experience its vibrant history and diverse offerings without the need for a large budget.
